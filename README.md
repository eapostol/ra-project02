Repository for Project 2 - Instanews App

This is my submission for our second marked project in web development at Red Academy. Our goal is to replicate a top stories news feed website with articles pulled from NY Times using an AJAX call. The structure and styling of the site is built using HTML/CSS and with the use of JavaScript and jQuery to pull in the article data and manipulate it.
